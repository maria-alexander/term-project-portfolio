			<div class="three-qtr-width intro-text"><p>I decided to change career paths after graduating from West Chester University with a B.S in Professional Studies and a Minor in Nutrition and Business GIS when I found my true passion in technology and web development. After teaching myself the basics and realizing I had a real drive and aptitude for this industry, I enrolled at Southern New Hampshire University and got a second Bachelor's with highest honors in Information Technology, concentrating in Web Design and Development. Since graduation, I've been accepted and am pursuing my Masters at Boston University in Computer Information Systems and a concentration in Web Application Development. In addition to my education and freelance development experience, I currently work full time as a Digital Marketing Coordinator and have experience designing, developing, and maintaining websites, leading email marketing campaigns, and handling digital design projects for a large-scale website.</p><p>When I'm not learning new skills I've recently been exploring my new neighboorhood as my boyfriend and I moved 3,000 miles across the country to Seattle. We've been enjoying trying new restaurants and seeing the sights in the city. We're both big sports fans and have already been to a Seahawks/Rams game (Go Rams!) and are excited to go watch hockey games for the new Seattle team, the Kraken. I will be rooting for them as long as they are not playing the flyers, then all bets are off.<br/><br/>Below I've included a photo of Danny and myself as well as a link to my current portfolio.</p><br/><a class="btn" href="https://www.malexander.dev" target="_blank">View My Live Portfolio Here</a></div>
